# DeadLine-NewTask Idea

Here I put down some terms and some kind of requirements for this project. This page will be short, I promise.

## Project, Task and Tag

Project is the software project you work with.  
When listing all projects, the order of them is the priority: what is ranked higher has a higher priority.

Task is a small pieces in a project.  
Choosing the size of a task is very important: the idea is to stop the task list from growing infinitely. To accomplish this requirement, each task should be marked done in days. Try to consider how much workload of a task, when a task takes 4-6 working hours to be done, it should be in a good spot.

Just like the project list, the ordering of a task list is the priority. In addition, there are some optional flags that is generally useful (like `important`, `target complete date`)

Tag is an extended part from the task name: `#atag`  
It store a plain text, usually a single word, to better describe a task. Multiple tags could be assigned in the task name, but having too many tags (e.g. >3 tags) may looks bad to be showed.

## Helper List

Helper list is a collection of tasks from different proejcts.  
When working on different projects at once, these helper lists are... helpful!  
But for single project workflow ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” I guess more study is needed...
